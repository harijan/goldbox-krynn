/* What differs between the games the port plays: one descriptor a game,
 * chosen once at startup (--game) and reached through game->rules (and,
 * in the tools without a game, passed in). Shared code reads what it needs
 * here and never asks which game it is. Champions of Krynn's is
 * cok_rules_champions; see DEVELOPERS.md's "Games".
 *
 * The descriptor holds names so far: the game's files and file sets, the
 * saved games' and characters' names, the titles. Each concern is a
 * section of its own, so that later sections (the character record's
 * layout, the data segment's tables, the ECL's, the spells') are added
 * beside these without moving them.
 *
 * A DAX archive is named by its stem: "GEO" and the ECL file's number
 * make GEO1.DAX; a stem the game reads with no number ("SKY") is the
 * whole name. The original spells some of them in lower case (Assign's
 * 'debug.txt', 'midi.dax'); DOS ignores the case, and the port, as the
 * files are shipped, uses upper case. */
